# Dotfiles
These are my dot files. I primarily use [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org) but I decided to give [Debian Testing](https://www.debian.org/) a try. I also run Debian or Ubuntu on a few server type systems, so I also try to make sure my dotfiles work there as well.

**The main things here are:**
1. My [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration (Soon™). 
2. My [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.
3. My window manager configuration.
4. My [URxvt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/rxvt-unicode) configuration.
5. My configs for [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) (Also Soon™).

## My Setup
Currently, my main system is running Debian Testing. At the moment I am using the [i3 Window Manager](https://i3wm.org/), in the past I've used dwm, bspwm, Xmonad and pretty much everything under the sun, but i3 is usually available everywhere and is easy to configure so I decided to settle on it for now; I use Picom for transparency and whatnot, URxvt as my main terminal, and [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) as my text editor and of course, [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). You can view all of my dotfiles here, you can probably see where I draw inspiration from if you look close enough.
